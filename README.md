# Monte Carlo Simulation for Long-Term-Care Insurance (Group Project)-
Built a Monte Carlo simulation model in Python to evaluate the Net Present Value (NPV) of long-term care insurance policies under uncertainty in mortality, morbidity, and cost escalation.  Modeled stochastic longevity, heavy-tailed claim cost distributions, and random interest rate paths to stress-test policy profitability.  Performed multiple simulation runs, analyzed probability distributions of NPV, and computed Value-at-Risk (VaR) to quantify downside risk.  Presented actionable insights on premium adjustments and reserve strategies to improve portfolio sustainability and mitigate adverse scenarios.
